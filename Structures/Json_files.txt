Dust plumes rise around it, and smaller figures in stillsuits are visible working around the machine. The scene is dominated by the ochre and brown of the desert and the metallic grey of the harvester.",

The room is decorated with gothic and industrial elements, and the lighting is harsh and dramatic, emphasizing his grotesque features and air of cruel power. The color scheme is dark and metallic, with hints of deep red and purple."
